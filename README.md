Propose an encoder-decoder structure (called HA02) which exploits the attention mechanism to focus on the most important input information. In particular, we implement a transformer encoder block as the encoder to achieve the sparsity in the input features and a residual neural network as the decoder respectively. Using 3GPP channel models, our simulations show superior estimation performance compared with other candidate neural network methods for channel estimation.
